<h2>Word Counter project </h2>

<br/> It's a simple Word Counter Project using TypeScript. This handy tool first prompts users to select whether they'd like to count words or letters. Once chosen, it efficiently calculates either the word count or letter count accordingly. Users simply input a sentence, and voila! The word counter displays the desired count.
<br/> Additionally, I've incorporated sleek chalk-style design for a visually pleasing experience..
